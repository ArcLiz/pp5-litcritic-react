## I'm sorry
I would like to extend my sincere apologies for the current state of this project and its documentation. Due to unforeseen challenges, including technical difficulties and time constraints, I was unable to meet the expected standards and complete the project as intended. I acknowledge that the result does not meet the requirements set forth, and therefore, I apologize in advance.

I genuinely hope that despite the current shortcomings, you will consider the effort and dedication invested. Any feedback and constructive criticism you could provide would be immensely valuable to me as I strive to improve and complete the project to both yours and my standards.

This documentation will include headers and short comments about things I have yet to complete or been able to collect in this document.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

## UX
### User Stories
I planned the bare bones of my project by using a project kanban board, which is linked to my old repository that had issues causing it to malfunction completely. You can find the project board [here](https://github.com/users/ArcLiz/projects/5). I have not had the opportunity to create user stories and issues for things such as styles, testing, refactoring etc, nor have I been able to do those things for the project.
### Admin Stories
I meant to build an admin interface for the front end, in order to do the things that only admins can do (such as edit and delete books)
### Website Goals
My primary goal for this project is to incorporate it in a previous Library project of mine so that they together can become a full fledged book hub for avid readers and book enthusiasts and collectors.
